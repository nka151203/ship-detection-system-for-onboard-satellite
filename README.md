# **On-Board Ship Detection System: Optimized AI for Optical Satellite-Based Image Filtering**

![alt text](system.png)

## 1. Overview

**Scenario:**
In satellite-based Earth observation systems, transmitting all captured images to the ground is highly resource-intensive due to limited onboard storage, energy, and bandwidth. To address this issue, our system automatically **detects ships in optical satellite images** and **only transmits relevant images** ‚Äî those containing ships ‚Äî back to Earth.

This selective transmission significantly reduces the data load while maintaining essential information quality for maritime monitoring and analysis.

However, deploying AI directly on satellites presents unique challenges: limited computational power, strict energy constraints, and small memory capacity. Therefore, the **core AI models** must be carefully optimized to achieve a balance between **accuracy** and **efficiency**. Achieving this balance is crucial for the successful deployment of onboard AI systems.

## 2. Dataset and Tech

**Dataset:**
The project uses the **Airbus Ship Detection Challenge 2018** dataset organized by Airbus. The dataset contains approximately **193,000 RGB optical satellite images** of size **768√ó768 pixels**, but only about **one-fourth of the images actually contain ships**.
Ground-truth labels are provided as **pixel-wise masks**, which were preprocessed into **bounding boxes** using the following approach:

* Determine the smallest and largest pixel indices horizontally (`xmin`, `xmax`) and vertically (`ymin`, `ymax`).
* Construct the bounding box from `(xmin-1, ymin-1)` to `(xmax+1, ymax+1)`.
* Skip the ¬±1 adjustment if the box touches the image border.

Although Airbus does not specify the dataset‚Äôs spatial resolution, based on the specifications of its operational satellites ‚Äî **Pl√©iades Neo (0.3 m)**, **Pl√©iades (0.5 m)**, **Vision-1 (0.87 m)**, and **SPOT (1.5 m)** ‚Äî the dataset is estimated to consist of **sub-meter optical imagery**, suitable for ship detection research.

## 3. Model Information
The models **YOLOv8nn** and **YOLOv11nn** were trained on the preprocessed dataset using **PyTorch 3.12** with **pre-trained COCO weights**. To support onboard deployment, we implemented two quantization strategies:

| Model                    | Description                                                                         |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **YOLOv8nn (INT8PQ)**    | YOLOv8n nano converted from float32 ‚Üí int8 post-training quantization.               |
| **YOLOv11nn (INT8PQ)**   | YOLOv11n nano converted from float32 ‚Üí int8 post-training quantization.              |
| **YOLOv8nn (QAT+INT8)**  | YOLOv8n nano trained with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) before int8 post-training quantization.  |
| **YOLOv11nn (QAT+INT8)** | YOLOv11n nano trained with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) before int8 post-training quantization. |

## üåö Limitations and Future Work

* The dataset used represents only a subset of the original Airbus dataset to fit hardware limitations, hence may not capture all image variations.
* Never try on a real satellite.
* Future work aims to:

  * Integrate the quantized models into **real onboard AI pipelines** for satellite testing.
  * Explore **multi-class detection** (e.g., ships, ports, clouds).
  * Develop **real-time embedded inference** and **event-based transmission strategies**.
